## Technology Stack

### Backend (`packages/backend/`)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (implied from structure)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for real-time features
- **Logging**: Winston logger with file rotation
- **Environment**: dotenv for configuration

### Mobile App (`packages/mobile/`)
- **Framework**: React Native 0.72.4
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Build System**: Metro bundler
- **Android**: Gradle build system with Kotlin support
- **iOS**: Xcode project structure
- **State Management**: (To be determined from src/)
- **Navigation**: (To be determined from src/)

### Admin Panel (`packages/admin/`)
- **Framework**: (To be determined - likely React/Next.js)
- **Language**: TypeScript/JavaScript
- **Purpose**: Restaurant/order management interface

└── index.ts        # Application entry point
```

### Key Features
- RESTful API architecture
- Real-time communication via WebSockets
- Structured logging system
- Environment-based configuration
- TypeScript for type safety

└── utils/          # Utility functions
```

### Key Features
- Cross-platform mobile application
- TypeScript for type safety
- Modern React Native architecture
- Android and iOS support
- Development and production builds

### Build Configuration
- **Android**: Gradle 8.0.1, Android Gradle Plugin 8.0.1
- **Kotlin**: Version 1.8.10 for Android compatibility
- **Target SDK**: Android API level configuration
- **Metro**: React Native bundler configuration

## Development Environment

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v24.0.2+
- npm/yarn package manager
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
- TypeScript compiler

### Development Scripts
- `npm start`: Start Metro bundler
- `npm run android`: Run on Android device/emulator
- `npm run ios`: Run on iOS device/simulator
- `npm test`: Run test suite
- `npm run build`: Build for production

## Database Schema (Inferred)

Based on the food delivery domain, the application likely includes:

### Core Entities
- **Users**: Customer accounts, authentication, profiles
- **Restaurants**: Restaurant information, menus, availability
- **Orders**: Order management, status tracking, history
- **Menu Items**: Food items, categories, pricing
- **Delivery**: Delivery tracking, driver assignment
- **Payments**: Payment processing, transaction history

### Relationships
- Users → Orders (one-to-many)
- Restaurants → Menu Items (one-to-many)
- Orders → Menu Items (many-to-many)
- Orders → Delivery (one-to-one)

## API Architecture (Inferred)

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout

### Core API Endpoints
- `GET /restaurants` - List restaurants
- `GET /restaurants/:id/menu` - Restaurant menu
- `POST /orders` - Create order
- `GET /orders/:id` - Order details
- `PUT /orders/:id/status` - Update order status
- `GET /users/profile` - User profile
- `PUT /users/profile` - Update profile

### Real-time Features (Socket.io)
- Order status updates
- Delivery tracking
- Restaurant availability changes
- Live chat support

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication
- Environment variable configuration
- Input validation middleware
- CORS configuration
- Rate limiting (implied)
- Secure API endpoints

## Deployment Architecture

### Backend Deployment
- Environment-based configuration
- Logging system for monitoring
- Process management (PM2 likely)
- Database connection pooling

### Mobile App Distribution
- Android APK generation
- iOS App Store builds
- Development/staging/production environments
- Code signing and certificates

## Current Development Status
